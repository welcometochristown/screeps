1). Harvestors should use all resources, will allow for more harvestors to exist [x] ( not entirely sure this is working (i.e repairers))
2). Non active screeps should stay in holding area (denoted by flag) [x]
3). Soldiers [ ]
4). Long distance couriers [ ]
5). Use error codes a bit more to denote change in action [ ] -- actually this is bad as travel time is wasted
6). Spawn creeps for building in neighbouring (non-spawn) room (maybe look for another room and use its spawn) determine required roles based on structures? [ ]\
7). Dont spawn full size creeps, it uses too much resources. Scale these appropriately. [ ]
